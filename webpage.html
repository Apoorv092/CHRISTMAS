Christmas is an annual festival celebrated on December 25 by Christians all over the world to honor the birth of Jesus Christ.<br>
<strong>2. What Is Xmas</strong><br>
Xmas or Xmass is the shortened form of the word Christmas.<br>
The origin of “X” is the Greek letter Chi, which is the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet and initial letter in the word Christós (Χριστός).<br>
“mas” is from the word “Mass”.<br>
There is a misconception about the word “Xmas” that the word “Christ” is replaced by “X” in the word “Christmas” as a secular attempt to withdraw religious tradition from Christmas.<br>
However, the word “Xmas” is used since the 16th century.<br>

Christians celebrate Christmas every year on the day of 25 December.

<strong>4. Why Is Christmas On December 25th – Why Do We Celebrate Christmas On December 25</strong>
<br>Not a single and confirm logic exists to explain why we celebrate Christmas on December 25th.
Christians celebrate it as the birthday of Jesus, however, his exact date of birth is unknown.
The earliest record of Christmas celebration on December 25th date backs to 336 AD when Constantine was the Roman Emperor. Yet, at that time, Christmas was not an official celebration.
It is a common belief that the early Church probably chose December 25th as the birthday of Jesus to coincide with the ancient pagan Roman festivals of midwinter; the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-rome/saturnalia">“Saturnalia”</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus">“Dies Natalis Solis Invicti”</a>. In such a way, it was easy to persuade the Roman pagans to accept Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire.</p>
